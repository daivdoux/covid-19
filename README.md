# covid-19: data, charts and interpretations in Europe
I worked on COVID-19 (Coronavirus) to see how it spreads around the world. I built charts and collected data, built dashboards and interpretations...

You can see how the virus spreads in France, Luxembourg, Spain, Belgium, United Kingdom (UK) compared to Italy and China.

## Data
You can find 2 datasets:
- Data downloaded from (). Data come from WHO (World Health Organization).
- Personal data.

The two dataset are then merged into a more complete dataset.

## Dashboard
I created a dashboard where you can find 4 of the charts I generate. It is refreshed every 4 hours.
