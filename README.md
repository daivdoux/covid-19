# COVID-19: data, statistics and charts
You can find on this repository many charts and data about Coronavirus (COVID-19) disease, especially in Europe. Most of data come from [CSSE](https://systems.jhu.edu) (Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering), but I also add data of my own to have up-to-date data.

French data come frome [INSEE](https://insee.fr/fr/accueil) (Institut National des Statistiques et des Études Économiques) and [Santé Publique France](https://www.santepubliquefrance.fr).

For more information and comments in French, you can follow me on Twitter: [@guillaumerozier](http://twitter.com/guillaumerozier).

## Confirmed cases of COVID-19

# Main Charts
All charts are listed above. But, here are the main one, so you don't have to download every one.

## Confirmed cases
### Total cases
![](./images/charts/cases.png)

### Total cases for 1 million inhabitants
That's simply the total number of cases over time for each countr divided by the total population of the country.
![](./images/charts/cases_per_1m_inhabitant.png)

### Total cases for 1 million inhabitants, aligned
Same chart, but every curve is aligned with Italy. That's an easier way to compare how fast the curves grow.  
![](./images/charts/cases_per_1m_inhabitant_aligned.png)

### Total cases for 1 million inhabitants, since "x cases/mill. hab."
![](./images/charts/cases_per_1m_inhabitant_since.png)

## Deaths
### Total deaths
![](./images/charts/deaths.png)

### Total deaths for 1 million inhabitants
That's simply the total number of deaths over time for each countr divided by the total population of the country.

# Dashboard (deprecated)
I will do a better one soon...
I created a [dashboard](https://plot.ly/dashboard/worldice:14/) where you can find 4 of the charts I generate.
