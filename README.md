# COVID-19: data, statistics and charts
You can find on this repository many charts and data about Coronavirus (COVID-19) disease, especially in Europe. Most of data come from [CSSE](https://systems.jhu.edu) (Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering), but I also add data of my own to have up-to-date data.

French data come frome [INSEE](https://insee.fr/fr/accueil) (Institut National de la Statistiques et des Études Économiques) and [Santé Publique France](https://www.santepubliquefrance.fr).

# World: All Charts
Below are all the charts done. You can download the `PNG` file by clicking on the PNG link for each chart. You will soon be able to access and download interactive HTML charts.

## Confirmed cases of COVID-19

**[PNG (linear scale)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rozierguillaume/covid-19/master/images/charts/cases.png)** • **[PNG (log. scale)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rozierguillaume/covid-19/master/images/charts/log_yaxis/cases.png)** • **Confirmed cases**.
This chart represents the total number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 against time, in days.

Same as the first one, but each country is displayed from the day a certain threshold has been reached. This makes it possible to compare the recent increase in the number of cases between countries.

Same as the first one, but the number of cases is divided by the population of each country. So the plotted data is the number of confirmed cases for 1 million inhabitants.

Same as the third one, but each curve is aligned on Italy using the Least Squares method. It is easier to compare the progression of each curve.

# Main Charts
All charts are listed above. But, here are the main one, so you don't have to download every one.

## Confirmed cases
### Total cases
![](./images/charts/cases.png)

### Total cases for 1 million inhabitants
That's simply the total number of cases over time for each countr divided by the total population of the country.
![](./images/charts/cases_per_1m_inhabitant.png)

### Total cases for 1 million inhabitants, aligned
Same chart, but every curve is aligned with Italy. That's an easier way to compare how fast the curves grow.  
![](./images/charts/cases_per_1m_inhabitant_aligned.png)

### Total cases for 1 million inhabitants, since "x cases/mill. hab."
![](./images/charts/cases_per_1m_inhabitant_since.png)

## Deaths
### Total deaths
![](./images/charts/deaths.png)

### Total deaths for 1 million inhabitants
That's simply the total number of deaths over time for each countr divided by the total population of the country.

### Total deaths for 1 million inhabitants, aligned
Same chart, but every curve is aligned with Italy. That's an easier way to compare how fast the curves grow.

# Dashboard (deprecated)
I will do a better one soon...
I created a [dashboard](https://plot.ly/dashboard/worldice:14/) where you can find 4 of the charts I generate.

# Data
You can find 2 datasets:
- Data downloaded from [CSSE](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19). Data come from WHO (World Health Organization).
- [INSEE](https://insee.fr/fr/accueil) (Institut National de la Statistiques et des Études Économiques)
- [Santé Publique France](https://www.santepubliquefrance.fr).
- Personal data (added manually).

The two dataset are then merged into a more complete dataset.
